Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
 1) Added support for time data as requested by Dmitry Solitsky.
 2) Added support for Python 2.4 as requested by Lukasz Szybalski.
 3) Added support for setting the autocommit flag in the connection constructor
    since some drivers do not support transactions and raise a "driver not
    capable" exception if any attempt is made to turn autocommit off; thanks to
    Carl Karsten for working with me to resolve this problem.
 4) Added support for calculating the size and display size of columns in the
    description attribute of cursors as requested by Carl Karsten.
 5) Use SQLFreeHandle() rather than SQLCloseCursor() since closing a cursor in
    the ODBC sense is not the same as closing a cursor in the DB API sense and
    caused strange exceptions to occur if no query was executed before calling
    cursor.close().
 6) Added additional documentation to README.txt as requested by Lukasz
    Szybalski.
 7) Tweaked setup script and associated configuration files to make it easier
    to build and distribute; better support for building with cx_Logging if
    desired.

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
 1) Added support for determining the columns, column privileges, foreign keys,
    primary keys, procedures, procedure columns, tables and table privileges
    available in the catalog as requested by Dmitry Selitsky.
 2) Added support for getting/setting the autocommit flag for connections.
 3) Added support for getting/setting the cursor name which is useful for
    performing positioned updates and deletes (as in delete from X where
    current of cursorname).
 4) Explicitly set end of rows when SQL_NO_DATA is returned from SQLFetch() as
    some drivers do not properly set the number of rows fetched.
