 1) Added support for determining the columns, column privileges, foreign keys,
    primary keys, procedures, procedure columns, tables and table privileges
    available in the catalog as requested by Dmitry Selitsky.
 2) Added support for getting/setting the autocommit flag for connections.
 3) Added support for getting/setting the cursor name which is useful for
    performing positioned updates and deletes (as in delete from X where
    current of cursorname).
